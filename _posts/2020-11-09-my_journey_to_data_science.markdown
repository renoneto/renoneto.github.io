Hello, I'm Reno, an aspiring Data Scientist. My attempt with this blog post is to explain why I've been studying Data Science over the last two years and why I love this.

### How it all started - VBA
I have a bachelor's degree in Business Administration with concentration in Finance, so Microsoft Excel was my first exposure to the world of data. Early on, I realized it was a powerful tool and invested some of my time learning a bit more about it. That's when I began watching tutorials and reading articles on VBA (Visual Basic - the programming language of Excel).

The scalability and power of automating several repetitive tasks using VBA were amazing to me, and didn't take long for me to see that it was useful to businesses.

### The Discovery üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Then I decided to go to Berkeley and study Entrepreneurship and Finance. And living in the Bay Area changes how you see the world, and that was when I started hearing more about Artificial Intelligence and how tech companies were using it.

As I read more about, the more intrigued I was. It sounded really powerful and, at the same time, so complicated for me to understand. 

How could someone create an algorithm to predict stock prices? Or build self-driving cars? Or create recommendation tools that understand what you want? What was an algorithm? I didn't realize that Machine Learning has been in my life for a long time.

### The Epiphany üí°- A complete random event that changed my life
In the meantime, an engineer who was leaving the company I worked for wanted to show me what he did. I had no idea what he was talking about, but that was my first exposure to Python/Pandas. As soon as he started explaining the pipelines he had built (_at the time, I didn't know what a pipeline was_), I had an epiphany. I began to see all the things I could do with Python: automate several tasks, schedule downloads, change files, reconciliations, create custom workflows, web scraping, etc.

As soon as the meeting was over, I started reading more about Python. VBA's similarity made it easy for me to understand if statements, for loops or defining variables. At the same time, I realized that VBA was nothing compared to Python.

### Python Python Python! üêçüêçüêç
By the end of the following month, I had watched several videos on YouTube and purchased some courses on EdX/Coursera. The learning curve was steep, and I faced many problems because I didn't have my co-worker to help me out. However, the community, documentations, and StackOverFlow were there for me. ‚ù§Ô∏è

As soon as I learned a few things, I started to apply at work. Nobody has asked me to do anything, but I knew it was the right thing to do, and it would completely change the way people work in the organization.

### Breaking the intimidating barrier of Machine Learning üí™
While searching/studying/implementing the things I've built, I kept seeing these 'Machine Learning Courses' everywhere. I hesitated. _"It's too hard, I'll never understanding this, I'm not that smart"_, I kept telling myself. 

Then I gave it a try. As I went through videos, I realized that actually, it was not so complicated. Most of the statistical concepts I had already learned in college and doing the first few exercises gave me the confidence I needed to continue. 

As I read more about it, the more fascinating I found it. The fact that it's an ever-evolving field with infinite things to learn is so exciting. I cannot imagine myself doing something else.

### Predicting my future - Always in learning-mode ü§ì
I don't need an algorithm to tell me that I'll be doing this for a long time. I think that Python/Machine Learning completely changed my life, my career, and goals. 

Today, I'm a student at Flatiron. I'm taking their Self-Paced Data Science Bootcamp, and I expect to learn a lot from it. The most important thing, though, is that I know that this is not the end of it.

The most important thing I've learned from all of this experience: **Never stop learning!** And that's what I'm going to do!
